# english_practice
An interactive script that I made for my kid to help him in practicing his English vocabulary.
#
It is a terminal based program that tries to imitate a communitaction with the kid and propmpts him/her to input commands.
#
The program relies on an online self-hosted Postgres server for managing the database of known words and their translations.
#
The backend uses Python and psycopg2 library for the database manipualtion.
#
An additional Google Gemini API is also used for spelling checks and translations.
